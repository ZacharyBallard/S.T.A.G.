Sub Teachers for All Grades
•	A brief introduction to your website idea. 
-	For many teachers, finding a substitute teacher is extremely difficult. In some districts where the school system coordinates the logistics the teachers have no idea who is in the room with their students. This opens issues because it is unknown to the teacher as to what the substitute’s qualifications are when leaving the type of work for the students. Some districts do not have any substitute management system and the teachers simply have a list of 40-50 substitute numbers to manually contact when they are in need. This can lead to a multitude of issues including teachers being unable to find a substitute. STAG (substitute teaching all grades) is a website application that would solve this issue by providing an online portal that would allow teachers needs and substitute availability to easily be identified and coordinated. 

•	State the goals of the project.
-	Streamline logistics for both teachers and substitute teachers.
-	Ease the process for teachers to be in contact with substitute teachers.
-	Increase the booking rate for substitutes looking for work.
-	Allow for preferred qualifications needed to be identified 
-	Allow for substitute background and qualifications to be more identifiable.

•	The values / benefits (tangible and intangible) this application can bring to a company/organization/end user.
-	This web application is designed with the entire school system in mind. Teachers will have the ability to easily comb through available substitutes and quickly have help when the need arises. Substitute teachers will be able to showcase their abilities and qualifications in order to generate more bookings. For school districts that provide the service of locating substitutes they will be free from needing to coordinate the logistics involved with pairing substitutes with teachers. For school districts that do not provide this service they will be able to easily provide an excellent service for both teachers and substitute teachers that could increase job retention.
